    // As InternalClass and IInternalScope in this example are declared as internal in a different project, we need to do three things:
    // 1. The project that declares the internal types to be tested needs to include [assembly:InternalsVisibleTo("<THIS_PROJECT>")]
    //      so that this test project can reference the types
    // 2. Create an internal class declared once in the test project that can be the proxy to the Test<T> that points to an internal type
    // 3. xUnit test classes need to be public and therefore cannot inherit from Test<T> where T is declared as internal.
    //      We can get around this by using the TestProxy class that is then declared as a field in the test class rather than the test class inheriting from Test<T>
    //      This idea comes from https://pedro.digitaldias.com/?p=494

    // As per #2 above, declare this once in your test project
    internal class TestProxy<T> : Test<T> where T : class
    {
